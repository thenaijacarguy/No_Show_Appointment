# No_Show_Appointment
The Medical appointment attendance dataset to be investigated contains information from over 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment, and the reason behind the attendance . A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

<li>‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.</li>
<li>‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.</li>
<li>‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.</li>
<li>The 'SMS_received' columns shows patient that got an SMS reminder of their appointments.</li>
<li>The 'No-show' column can be confusing: it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.</li>


### Question(s) for Analysis
We would be trying to find pointers that might indicate why certain patients showed up to their appointment and if some variables directly influence their ability or decision to attend.
<li>What role does the gender of the patient have to play in their ability to show up for their appointment?</li>
<li>Does the length between the schedule day and appointment day influence the appointment attendance?</li>
<li>Is age a factor in the patients ability to attend their appointment?</li>
<li>Are some neighbourhoods more difficult to access the appointment venue than others?</li>
<li>Are patients enrolled in the 'Bosia Familia' more likely to attend their appointments?</li>
<li>Does receiving an SMS reminder influence patients attendance?</li>
